# Covid19-Data-Analysis-SQL

In this SQL project, I performed an exploratory analysis using the deaths and vaccination data tables of Covid-19 from March 2020 to June 2021. The analysis utilized a range of SQL queries, from basic to advanced.

The raw dataset was sourced from Our World in Data.

I used MS-SQL Server to import the Excel files into a SQL database on my local machine to conduct the analysis.
